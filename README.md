so adding gnupg, and going to spawn multiple fcgisockets to allow user auth to shell access 
can setup a curl based cli that can handle <otp<gnupg crypted verify cli command>> udp always on can survive tcp attacks etc etc + expand to entry / exit node burners
(sharable 64gig micro sdcards work wonders for otp burner lists... multiple ways to implement this) 

so gnupg, might be hard to decrypt messages but bruteforcing keys protected by human memorable length fail is laughable 
^ in your home directory with the same uid/gid that your browsers running as right? because thats sensible o and those ssh keys thanks for that

to conform to the always assume your owned logic key signing based on monthly weekly meet up can generate a signing private / public key
sign everything then deleted the private key, 

sign the public key with everyones key and there is no way for malicious users to abuse your private key because its living in /dev/null
and splitting the burden of protecting keys to everyone in the party who has different hardware/software/location setups is the best i can think of

you can always abuse a fotw secret or security through obscurity to do key exchange i mean they cant catch everything 

but the only way to guarentee forward secrecy that i know would be in person exchange
diffies good for radio but all radio fails at race conditions on both ends
and public key exhange well go search for goverenment black boxes or ask how much you trust a random unknown third party

catchpa's a pain in the arse to implement either spawning random images or wasting a lot of space holding images neither of which i can be bothered to do

setting up a otp entry or atleast looking at possiblities cant really rate limit bruteforcing other than iptables blocking so its a bit meh atm 

i did a load of theory on using botnets to bruteforce passwords and ended up with the simple logic that you cant stop password bruteforcing without
implementing a much simpler form of denial of service without catchpa...
i hate catchpa the harder it is to scan image/audio from a computing perspective the harder it is for a human to do it makes me rage inside

two factor auth destroyed all the theory i did, but doesnt stop the provider your recieving the external auth token from, from owning all your shit
the scary 3/4 letter agencys dont really care about security unless it can be implemented in a way they still get to control 
this method would be using your keys to send any 2 factor auth tokens over any provider crypted so only you have access 

from a hidden service perspective getting sms out without hammering and alerting nearby cell towers is hard so emails it is... 

the usb that can fry motherboards got me thinking of physical locks and nfc cards... if its possible to add a mechanical lock to a nfc card that on multiple 
wrong reads ie not the right order to extract data can build up a static charge that gradually erases memory? meh only way to solve the crypto bruteforcing problems 

after i dumped all my stuff i started getting owned pretty hard, this tends to happen alot hence why i talk like a tard i mean seriously who would read any of this
without prior knowledge of the writer i always assume most people would just outright ignore me 

once again no proof reading no logic order dump of thoughts 

when i leave git folders idle for a while they have a habit of dying so mostly checking it still works

please tell me noscript.filterXExceptions.yahoo isnt as lulz as o your a yahoo iframe perform all the xss you want because adverts...?
everytime i google it theres less and less information and the obscure names / only a true or false toggle in half of firefoxs about:config concerns me
seriously im not wasting another 2 hours of my life going through all the changes yahoo made to firefox to try and tell advertising companies to go fuck themselves
i need a new browser :( that only cares about html/css for text / layout control and can pass file extensions to system executables  
I dont really hate all advertising companies... if i want to buy something i always use google to find a product find reviews for a product and make purchasing desicions 
but when they start stalking me around the internet and invading my personal life i think i should be entitled to get a restraining order.

this thing really doesnt want me to test it on a mobile : / pfft somethings about to be thrown out the window openwrt apperently cant do wifi anymore... 
basically other than width being set to 100% the height is set entirely by the text size which can scale based on width or height
this kills any ability to zoom but scales well in dwm and tiling wm's and thats what ive got
but i cant test any of it till i fix my router probably not going to happen
pretty sure i need to work on scaling but i want a cheap and cheerfull template i can blag on different sized screens

seen loads of sites lately that dont rate limit there own internal search
and dont rate limit the ability to append results to this search
makes it easy to, spam new search entries and spam searches till the load gets stupidly large
##########################################################################################################################################################################################
basically im going to dump everything ive learnt from escrow sites into a webpanel /shrug
going to make a gnupg enabled message board (did this like 6? years ago in php minus the gnupg part)
poc some paranoid cookie settings + two factor reverse authentication
and going to poc the dispute pgp admin middle man that evo should be using / not even going to touch the clear text passwords : /
the login stuff i orginally had is lulz stupid if it isnt hardened and is only justifiable on an entry node easier to implement with netcat and cli to get access to a login page
most of this is just for me to play with if your expecting something secure and usable write it yourself

so for shits and giggles i decided it would be fun to copy my current ./config/chromium to a container on a bridge interface that passes everything through a tor transparent proxy...
installed chromium on the node added user agent switcher just to make sure...

boot the node ran chromium poof identical running browser with every open tab and full auth to all things google 

so i magically just appeared in sweeden and started requesting access to services with an authentication token that was generated in the uk 
not only this but from a different browser assuming cookies can be copied directly

back to the box running from real ip... 
account... security... security checkup... 
the only ips that get logged are done so at authentication time when the cookies are generated so not a single alarm bell popping up

now have a session running from a country thats never had access to my account before that i cant close and that for what im looking at right now wouldnt even know existed 

played about a bit more and password changing flushes every single device and requires the password to be input again... pretty much a deauth all active sessions button
that being the only way to kill unknown connections

so you can have persistent stealth account access to all google services through tor so long as you can copy the auth token off a target node : /
and persistence will last until the target changes their password

pretty sure if i was to ever use gdrive to host any thing important i would want minimum real tracking of every node that has access to my account : / 
either that or change my password everytime i log out 

anyway this pissed me off so its going here

sucky attempt at a quick lan file transfer doesnt actually work...
copied over a tar file naming scheme doesnt work with it at all and it bailed just before decompressing the last file so going to fix it
used to use python simplehttp to transfer files but would be easier to have a throw up stupidly insecure lan ftp website instead
atleast it would help as a fall back for my current setup

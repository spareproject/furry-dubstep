So actual progress and slightly less concerned about the whole sudo iptables : / /gulp
nginx now cant edit its own executables if i set chattr +i on the config file and everything else just to make sure

everything still pretty fucking horribly laid out so moar web design crap 
and i still need a database with username password knock_set values and will look at storing passwords server side probably needs last successfull login - last failed login - last ip location access any general information
that will be usefull for debugging printed on to screen once ive setup scripted access will look at actually implementing more things 









output being returned by fcgiwrap?

so doesnt matter who the fuck the fcgiwrap user is... 
it always executes if 
location /... root
&&
location ~ \.cgi$... root 
are the same 

the two dirs can be owned by whoever the fuck wants them 
even if cgi-bin is nginx:nginx and fcgiwrap.service executes as nginx:nginx the thing fucking fails ?


  basically if i can not stop nginx from having control over executables the entire thing goes to shit and isnt worth looking at 
  fin.



so sshd + sshfs 

sshd needs ro access to the groups that can host remotely / + chattr +i to its own configs considering any user can decide to just start a sshd server iptables is the only root stopping netcat / sshd
so far only transmission... 
or seperate wheel / users into public  

auto detect nodes and mount all would probably dos itself still dont get why nested mounts didnt loop mount forever

as in node0 
remote mounts node1 /mnt into /mnt
node1 remote mounts node0 /mnt into its /mnt :

still need to 


so setting sub directory for fcgi disables access to that directory not every directory i failed at chown nginx : /



































so using a grid layout with tiles... 

to create a tile you need an include... on click navigates to the tiles page, and a tile 
auto filling 
basically no catch all 




so index.html includes bash.cgi 

the graphical part... 
want the top panel to be draggable down..
resulting in the admin panel taking the top position
and the panel stats taking bottom
leaving the middle as a shell 

so two static bars 

############# admin panel   ################

container - probably just a terminal 

############# default panel ################

container - the web based graphical

############# notification/debuggery panel #

could make a lot of none click guis but would be relient on using the mouse in a maze top panel would switch constantly till you mouse straight down out of it and tablet would be forced to hold it
but to mimic the immersive thing would be pretty easy if its just grid refereces








so tested all the things till they broke 

pretty much half and halfed between python and bash depending on what i could remember
so going to build up from index.html which can default boot into either a bash session / webcgi , or a python session /webcgi?
dont like having to make decisions between them 
and all the bloat will disapear to a shiny bootable home page that will probably change alot will keep an old folder as to start a c&p lib

so actual goals that would be usefull...
have fstab ready to mount /dev/sda onto /mnt/internal???? 
need to sort out mointing one dropable dir to hold containers 
/mnt/storage0, /mnt/storage1 - auto mount all the things?
or /mnt/internal rbind all the things?






so cgi server 

user cookies on server 
user requests cookie over a unique dh 

will stick a messaging app on it 


server database - 
uuid,
password,
email,
recovery, 

date-created,



client database - 
uuid,
session-password,





so ive actually been locked out of websites before google buisness for one royal mail whatever the fuck its suppose to be as another 

*assuming that a browser is actually secure enough to store anything : /

time problems 
checking for unique usernames... in real time means you pretty much want a remote keylogger when the input box is clicked sounds evil just thinking about it
but makes search faster can start picking tables to search from based on key strokes entered in teh background 



o and as far the pension shit goes rm can go fuck itself why should i invest in my future (give rm a load of money to hold onto so they can piss it all away again)
when they wont even give a full time contract u no invest in my future then you can lick my fucking crack you evil cunts fuck off and die /now plox thanks k BYE!

in short why the fuck should i invest if they outright refuse to invest in me
